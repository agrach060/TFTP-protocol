# TFTP Protocol Implementation

## A tftp client and server over UDP
* Transfer (read/write) small files
* Transfer (read/write) large files

This project provides a complete implementation of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) for file transfer between a client and a server. TFTP is a simple, lock-step, file transfer protocol that allows a client to get from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network. This implementation is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it ideal for scenarios where simplicity and efficiency are key.
